# bevy-bow

A projectile motion game inspired by one of my earlier Godot projects in Kotlin. If you are interested in the physics behind projectile motion, you can check them out here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectile_motion#:~:text=Projectile%20motion%20is%20a%20form,the%20action%20of%20gravity%20only.

This was my first introduction into Bevy as well Entity-Component-Systems (ECS). Since I had some experience with dependency injection, Bevy ECS felt really intuitive and I am a huge fan of their API (in most aspects). 

Gameplay:
Your mouse cursor moves a bow. You can draw the bow by clicking the left mouse button and moving your mouse. The goal is shoot all the birds in their own little area (hint: there will be an ifinite amount of birds).
